# Results

Every score on this site comes from one laptop. Open one note. Each
note is one question, what I typed, and what happened.

**Not ready for daily work.** That bar means beating a plain 8B both at
picking the next step and at fixing a real bug the helper cannot do
itself. It does not, yet.

Public pages do not name other editors or chat products.

## Which model

| Note | In one sentence |
| --- | --- |
| [Which model]({{ '/investigations/which-model/' | relative_url }}) | Evening daily: 8B 9/9, 7B coder 7/9. Idle SWE 180s then 2.2s. New tier-6 bench; past 180s not run. Keep the 8B. |
| [The instrument was broken]({{ '/investigations/measuring/' | relative_url }}) | A day comparing models found two faults in the benchmark instead. Every model number before this is unsafe. |
| [The fence was the whole story]({{ '/investigations/the-fence/' | relative_url }}) | The hosted 32B was never the problem. 1 of 10 became 9 of 10 once four backticks stopped reaching the Python parser. |
| [Two models, one wall]({{ '/investigations/two-models/' | relative_url }}) | The same 75 jobs. 51 vs 50. They fail in opposite ways. |
| [Model lanes]({{ '/investigations/model-lanes/' | relative_url }}) | Which local weight for a question, a write, or a ship. Default stays 8B. |
| [Hub models]({{ '/investigations/hub-models/' | relative_url }}) | Idle SWE 180s then 2.2s. New tier-6 bench; past 180s not run. Do not switch. |
| [Cloud weights]({{ '/investigations/cloud-weights/' | relative_url }}) | A larger model on a rented GPU. The helper stays on this machine. |
| [Everyday laptop]({{ '/investigations/everyday-laptop/' | relative_url }}) | Why the 0.5B adapter is a demo, not daily work. |
| [Bench record]({{ '/investigations/bench-record/' | relative_url }}) | The machine, what fits in 18 GB, and the runs behind the numbers. |

## What we measured

| Note | In one sentence |
| --- | --- |
| [Experiments]({{ '/investigations/experiments/' | relative_url }}) | Paper form. 0.5B means 500 million weights, not the daily 8B. |
| [0.5B exact stdout]({{ '/investigations/held-out-exec-eval/' | relative_url }}) | 18 scripts, three times each. 7 / 54, then 12 / 54 after one repair. |
| [0.5B sample-and-run]({{ '/investigations/sample-and-run/' | relative_url }}) | Four drafts found 9 / 18. A later loop 12 / 18. The adapter at greedy temperature: 0 / 54. |
| [0.5B vibe review]({{ '/research-vibe-review/' | relative_url }}) | Held-out short scripts, and a 100-file walk that was not a review. |
| [First-run four]({{ '/investigations/first-run-four/' | relative_url }}) | 0 / 4 by hand, then 4 / 4 once the helper did the compiler jobs. |
| [Same jobs, same evening]({{ '/investigations/same-jobs/' | relative_url }}) | Eleven demo tasks. Laptop 8B vs a hosted IDE agent. |
| [Local loop vs hosted agents]({{ '/investigations/local-vs-cloud/' | relative_url }}) | Every shipped path against a hosted IDE agent. |

## Where it fails

| Note | In one sentence |
| --- | --- |
| [Where the failures are]({{ '/investigations/failures/' | relative_url }}) | A third of runs fail. Most of those wrote the wrong code. |
| [When a run says done and means nothing]({{ '/investigations/false-finish/' | relative_url }}) | Five in ten claimed success having written nothing. After two fixes, none did. |
| [What the helper cannot fix]({{ '/investigations/limits/' | relative_url }}) | Cases where the helper knew the answer and the model still missed. |
| [Asking a bigger model]({{ '/investigations/asking-a-bigger-model/' | relative_url }}) | A run that stops to ask has already failed, three times in three. |
| [Small steps, measured]({{ '/investigations/small-steps/' | relative_url }}) | Splitting one hard job into easy ones bought nothing. |
| [What to improve]({{ '/investigations/what-to-improve/' | relative_url }}) | Gaps a helper can close, and gaps it cannot. |

## How it is built

| Note | In one sentence |
| --- | --- |
| [Fine-tune or harness]({{ '/investigations/fine-tune-or-harness/' | relative_url }}) | Do not train on 35 pairs or 30 seed traces. Later, about 2k clean turns. |
| [Small models, classic development]({{ '/investigations/small-llm-harness/' | relative_url }}) | How an 8B finishes careful work: checks, not hope. |
| [Harness comparison]({{ '/investigations/harness-comparison/' | relative_url }}) | What transfers from other published helpers. No free shell. |
| [Everyday skills]({{ '/investigations/everyday-skills/' | relative_url }}) | Each skill is one copy-paste step, written for an 8B. |
| [Skills]({{ '/skills/' | relative_url }}) | The twenty-four kit skills and when each one loads. |
| [Platform engineering]({{ '/investigations/platform-engineering/' | relative_url }}) | Small files that must work on every OS. |
| [Architecture]({{ '/architecture/' | relative_url }}) | Layers from the bottom up. A cycle fails the merge gate. |
