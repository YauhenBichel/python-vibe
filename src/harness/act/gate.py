"""May this draft be written? One question, asked before any file changes.

The tools carry a change out. This decides whether it may happen: a
module that already exists under another name, an import with nothing
behind it, a style rule the project keeps, a definition already in the
file. Keeping it apart from `tools` means the answer to "where are the
tools" is one file, and so is the answer to "what stops a bad write".
